What is the nature of a business?

Anyone who want start his/her business should anwser this question first. No standard answers for it, but you should think about it, before you seriously make up your mind to do it.

I personally love this summary from Quara:

```
The nature of business is transforming some resources into another resources of help, need of a larger population.
```

In a nutshell, nature of business is the process of resources to cash, Ask youself, Do you have any resources to sell?
